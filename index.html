                Hello! My name is Kayode Adetayo, and this is my project for the
                "Web Fundamentals" course. In this project, I explore the basics
                of web development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a
                simple, interactive website. It's a hands-on journey into
                creating clean, responsive, and accessible web pages.

            <p>
                Ekiti State, in southwestern Nigeria, is known for its rolling
                hills, rich cultural heritage, and dedication to education.
                Created in 1996, with Ado-Ekiti as its capital, the state is
                primarily agrarian, producing crops like cocoa and yams. Known
                as "The Land of Honor and Integrity," Ekiti is home to notable
                attractions like the Ikogosi Warm Springs and the Erin Ayonigba
                Sacred Fish River, making it a significant cultural and tourist
                destination in Nigeria.
